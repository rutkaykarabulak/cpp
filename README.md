# Description
This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms, including:

**Data Structures:**: Linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, and more.
**Programming Paradigms:** Recursion, dynamic programming, and other key paradigms.
**Algorithms:** Commonly used algorithms like binary search, merge sort, quick sort, etc.

## Purpose
* Purpose of this work has one and only main goal, which is having a deep and solid understanding of data structures and algorithms.

## Programming Language Choice
* Using the C++ programming language while implementing/learning the data structures is crucial since it has `pointer` mechanism
which allows you understand when/where to apply specific operations such as removal, inserting etc.

## Why Data Structures and Algorithms Matter
* While a deep knowledge of data structures and algorithms isn't mandatory for every software engineer, it is crucial for those aiming to secure well-paid jobs, especially in top tech companies, and it's impact on broading your perspective shouldn't underestimated.
